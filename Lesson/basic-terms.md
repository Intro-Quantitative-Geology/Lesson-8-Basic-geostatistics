# Basic statistical terms and concepts
In the lesson for this week we will be dealing with geochronological data, ages of geological material.
These ages can be measured in many ways, but often several minerals are dated from the same sample to try to reduce the geological uncertainty in the measured ages.
Even with extremely precise dating methods and excellent equipment, ages measured in geological materials are often quite variable owing to factor such as zoning of parent isotopes in minerals, partial loss of daughter isotopes, radiactive mineral inclusions, etc.
Before we can consider any of these factors, however, we'll need to understand some of the most basic statistical concepts.

## Populations and samples
For any kind of anaylsis one might perform on geological materials, we collect a *sample*.
