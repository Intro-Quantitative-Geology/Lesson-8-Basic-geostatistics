# Hints for Exercise 8

## Sigma notation
***Sigma notation*** is used to indicate values that should be added together or summed.
It is a shorthand notation to indicate the sum of *N* values, where each value in the set can be represented by the subscript *i*.
The example below shows how *sigma notation* works.

*Equation H1. Sigma notation indicating the sum of N values, each indicated by x*.

As you can see, the complete form explicitly states the starting and ending values for the sum (*i* = 1 and *N*), but often these values are not written as it can be assumed that all *N* values will be summed.
